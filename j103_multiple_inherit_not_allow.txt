why multiple inheritance in java is not allowed ?
indirectly multiple inheritance is possible using interface

class finalClass extends orignal implements interfaceclass1 , interfaceclass2 ....{}

only one extends allow but multiple iterrface also use

    class       interface       interface       interface

    phone       gps             media           cemra
    |           |                  |              |
    --------------------> smartphone <-------------

phone extends in smartphone because phone upgrade in smartphone and all basic attributes are same , but gps , media and cemra are different attributes use in smartphone , they are not convert to smartphone


    class           interface       interface       interface

    character       LeftMove        RigtMove         Jump
    |               |                  |              |

    action are constant never update

    note : method override is compersorly but attributes is not .
            you will create referance of interface not object .
