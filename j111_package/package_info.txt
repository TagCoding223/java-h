package also use to organize files .
javac f1.java -> f1.class
java f1.java -> program execute
javac -d . f1.java -> crate a package folder and f1.class file create here(create a class file as coresponding package)
javac *.java -> compiler all java files exist in folder
javac -d . *.java -> compiler all java file coresponting package and drop it folder
if multiple package available in folder file's than create multiple package folder

sub-folder
f1 -> package vishal.name;
    
    folder -> vishal
                | -> name(sub-folder)
                |      | -> f1.class


javac -d xyz *.java (not good for practice)
replace .(dot) to xyz(anything it just a folder name) and all package(folder) create under it .
these package once created can be used by other classes
create methods outside of psvm 
packages just like libarayes of c/c++
